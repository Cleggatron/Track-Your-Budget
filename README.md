  ## Description

  The idea for this project was to take an existing codebase and refactor it so that it utilised caching and indexedDB to provide offline support, (in the manner of a progressive web application). Here we are using a budget tracking app, which would allow someone to keep track of of their budget even without internet access, due to the utilisation of the cache and indexedDB

  ## Installation

  Once the repo has been cloned you would need to install dependencies with `npm i`. After this you can start it running locally with `npm start`. The project uses MongoDB, so you will also need this installed on your machine if being run locally. Alternatively if you were hosting online you would need to provision a database. If running locally then the project will be available on localhost:3000

  ## Usage

  ![File In Action](./assets/Screenshot.PNG)

  Once on the site the actual functionality is fairly simple. All you need to do is name the tranaction and set an amount. Then click add funds if this is a credit to your budget, or subtract funds if it is a debit.
